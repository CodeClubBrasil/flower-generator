## Make a custom block to draw flowers

+What if you want to draw lots of flowers? Instead of repeating the code, you can create your own block in Scratch and use it every time you want to draw a flower.  

+ Make a new block and name it `draw flower`:

+ You will see a new block called `draw flower` and a new definition block on the stage:

+ Move your code for drawing the flower from the `when green flag clicked` block to the new `draw flower` definition block. 

	Your code should look like this:

+ Clear the stage and click the green flag. Nothing will happen. That's because you have defined what the `draw flower` block should do, but not said when to do it. 

+ Add the following code to clear the stage and draw a flower when the green flag is clicked:

+ Test your code and make sure you see a flower. 

+ Now change your code to move and draw another flower:

+ Test your code to check whether you now see two flowers.
