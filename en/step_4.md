## Make a custom block to draw flowers

+ What if you want to draw lots of flowers? Instead of repeating the code you can create your own block in Scratch and use it whenever you want to draw a flower.  

	Make a new block and namee it 'draw flower':

+ You will see a new block called 'draw flower' and a new definition block on the stage:

+ Move your code for drawing the flower from the 'on green flag pressed' block to the new 'draw flower' definition block. 

	Your code should look like this:

+ Clear the stage and click the green flag. Nothing will happen. That's because you have defined what the 'draw flower' block should do, but not said when to do it. 

+ Add the following code to clear the stage and then draw a flower when the green flag is pressed:

+ Test your code and make sure you see a flower. 

+ Now change your code to move and draw another flower:

+ Test your code to see two flowers:

Can you use your 'make flower' block more times and draw more flowers?

Create a design that you like. Here's an example:

You don't have to use ellipse-shaped petals. This 'firework' pattern was created using a thick straight line and a black backdrop:

The 'petal' is just a line with the crosshair a bit below the bottom:
