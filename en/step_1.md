## Introduction

In this project you will create a 'draw flower' block that can create flowers of different sizes, shapes and numbers of petals. You'll use your new block to create random flower designs and flower patterns. You can adapt the project to create other interesting geometric patterns. 

You can export the patterns you have created on the stage to use as a wallpaper for your phone or desktop or to use as backdrops in other Scratch projects.
