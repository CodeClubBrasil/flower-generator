## Generating A Flower

First you're going to generate a flower with multiple petals that can be drawn on the screen. 

+ Create a new sprite with the Paint editor and draw a black filled in petal shape using the Ellipse tool. 

+ Write code to create a flower with 6 equally rotated petals when you click the green flag.

You'll need to repeat the code to stamp and rotate the petal 6 times. 
There are 360 degrees in a circle. Divide 360 by 6 to work out how many degrees each petal needs to be rotated by.

+ You can click the 'clear' button in the palette to clear stage

+ You may find that your petals are offset in an odd way:

This is because the sprite is rotated around its center. You can change where the center is. 

Can you change the center of your sprite so that the flowers look like this:

+ Instead of drawing the flower at the location of the sprite when the project is started, can you draw it at the location of the mouse pointer when the space key is clicked. Then you'll be able to draw lots of flowers.
