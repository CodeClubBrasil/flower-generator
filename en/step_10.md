## Challenge: Custom flower blocks with inputs

These flowers all have the same number of outer and inner petals and the size of the inner flower is in proportion to the outer flower:

So we can create a `draw double flower` custom block with inputs for `outer colour`, `inner colour` and `size`.

We can then use the `draw double flower` block to draw lots of flowers in the same style:

Note that we work out the size of the inner flower from the `size` input so that it's always in proportion.

Can you create a new custom block for a kind of flower that you like and just add the inputs that you want to be able to change? 

Then create a design that you like using your new block.
