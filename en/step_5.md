## Challenge: Create a flower design

Can you use your `draw flower` block more times and draw more flowers to create an interesting design?  

Create a design that you like. Here's an example:

You don't have to use ellipse-shaped petals. This 'firework' pattern was created using a thick straight line and a black backdrop:

The 'petal' is just a line with the crosshair a bit below the bottom:

Experiment with adding new petal costumes and see what you can come up with.
